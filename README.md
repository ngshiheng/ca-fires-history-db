# ca-fires-history-db

Tracking fire data from www.fire.ca.gov/incidents

This project is inspired by and adapts the work from [simonw/ca-fires-history](https://github.com/simonw/ca-fires-history). Instead of using Git scraping, this project stores the data in a SQLite database and uses GitHub artifacts for storage.
